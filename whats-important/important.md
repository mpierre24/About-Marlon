# What's important? 
What I feel is important to me is family, peace, money ðŸ˜Œ 

But one thing that I think is realy for me is to make some type of positive impact on the world whether it be in tech or not or my 
contribution is big or small that is a dream of mine that hopefully can make true ðŸŒŽ.
